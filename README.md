# üå≥ Decision Analysis Tree Simulation

This project models a decision-making scenario involving a land purchase that may yield oil. The simulation incorporates an expert‚Äôs predictive accuracy and calculates the expected monetary value (EMV) across varying accuracy rates.

---


## üß† Problem Summary

- Buy land for $180,000 with a chance of discovering oil.
- If oil is found: earn $1.8 million.
- An expert can be hired to predict oil presence with varying accuracy.

---

## üîç Objective

1. Construct a decision tree representing possible outcomes.
2. Perform sensitivity analysis on expert prediction accuracy.
3. Visualize EMV as a function of expert reliability.

---

## üìà Sensitivity Analysis

- Vary `P(Predict Oil | Oil)` and `P(Predict No Oil | No Oil)` from 0.5 to 0.8.
- Calculate updated posterior probabilities using Bayes‚Äô Theorem.
- Compute and compare EMVs with and without hiring the expert.
